# Tomato-Disease-Classifier-CNN-Project-
🍅 **Tomato Disease Classifier**

A web application that detects diseases in tomato plants using a **Convolutional Neural Network** (CNN). Users can upload an image of a tomato leaf, and the model will classify it as Healthy or one of several Diseased categories. The project is built using **TensorFlow**, **FastAPI** for the backend, and **HTML/CSS** for the frontend.

🧠 **Model Details**

**Framework**: TensorFlow / Keras
**Model Architecture**: CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)
**Training Epochs**: 31
**Model Format**: .h5
**Input**: Tomato leaf image
**Output**: Predicted class (e.g., Healthy, Bacterial Spot, Early Blight, etc.) and the Confidence score.

🚀 **Features**

Upload tomato leaf images through a simple web UI.
Real-time disease classification.
Lightweight FastAPI server for quick inference.
Modular structure for easy updates and scalability.

📈 **Future Improvements**

Add confidence score to predictions.
Deploy the app on a cloud platform (e.g., Render, Heroku, AWS).
Expand to other plant diseases.
